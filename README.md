This is the introduction to Android App Development class.

For this project we are developing an app called : Simon The Game. 
It is based on the game Simon. It will have three screens. The Start page which allows the user to select the difficultly they want. 
The second screen will allow them to play the game. It will display colors and they need to press them in the order the game displays them. The pattern will stay the same but each time it will add another button to press. 
The difficultly is in the amount of time and order the user has to press the buttons.
